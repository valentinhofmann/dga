# Derivational Graph Auto-encoder (DGA)

This repository contains the code and data for the ACL paper [A Graph Auto-encoder Model of 
Derivational Morphology](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.106.pdf).
The paper introduces the **Derivational Graph Auto-encoder (DGA)**, a model that learns 
embeddings capturing information about the compatibility of affixes and stems in derivation.

# Dependencies

The code requires `Python>=3.5`, `torch`, `torch_geometric`, `pickle`,  `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy`, and `sklearn`.
